# Micro-Tecture Blog Repository


## Intent

This repo is intended to serve as a tangible demonstration of how different patterns in a microservice have different results.

See the associated blog post to get a better overview!

## Overview

There are 3 main patterns being demonstrated here, each with their own branch:
- [Service Models](https://github.com/frumpled/blog-micro-tecture/tree/service-models)
- [Inverted Models](https://github.com/frumpled/blog-micro-tecture/tree/inverted-models)
- [Borrowed Models](https://github.com/frumpled/blog-micro-tecture/tree/borrowed-models)


There are also Pull Requests against each of these patterns' branches.  Two different changes are made to demonstrate and take measurements against this pattern:
- Adding a new field to existing models
- Upgrading an SDK causing breaking changes


## Notes

This is an incomplete example.
- There are no tests
- There are no metrics
- Minimal logging

To name a few.

Please keep in mind this is just an example to illustrate the differences between patterns.

It is NOT intended to provide a full, functional example of what a microservice should look like in its entirety.
